# Naptimes

A React JS Project to track Data of your Toddler/Baby/Child. Basically for getting myself into this "React Thing" - not meant for real usage.

## Setup

This Webapp uses Firebase Cloud Firestore. Add your Data to the `.env.local.example` File and remove the `.example` from the Filename.

Run `npm install` to install the needed modules and dependencies. After that, run the Project as every other Rect JS Project.

## Start the Project

Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
